### ✅ STEP 1: Open Terminal in Project Folder

Go to your React project folder in terminal:

```bash
cd path/to/your_name_project
```

---

### ✅ STEP 2: Initialize Git

If you haven't already:

```bash
git init
```

or

extra:
npx gitignore node
---

### ✅ STEP 3: Add & Commit Code

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

---

### ✅ STEP 4: Link to GitHub Repository

Remove any old remotes and add your correct repo:

```bash
git remote remove origin 
git remote add origin https://github.com/priyanshu-it/your_site.git
```

---

### ✅ STEP 5: Push Code to GitHub

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```
git push origin main --force
 
Now your code is pushed to GitHub:
🔗 [https://github.com/Priyanshu-it/your_site-in](https://github.com/Priyanshu-it/your_site-in)

---

### ✅ STEP 6: Install `gh-pages` package

```bash
npm install --save gh-pages
```

---

### ✅ STEP 7: Edit `package.json`

Open your `package.json`, and make two changes:

#### ➕ 1. Add `homepage` line near top:

```json
"homepage": "https://Priyanshu-it.github.io/your_site-in",
```

#### ➕ 2. Update `"scripts"`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",
  "build": "react-scripts build",
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

Save the file.

### ✅ STEP 8: Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

⏳ This will:
